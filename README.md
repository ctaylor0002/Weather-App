# Weather-App
Full stack application for weather tracking

This weather app could be a todo planner using the weather forecast to plan?

List of things To DO!

1. Decide what it is this app will do that makes it interesting.
    -   App could actively compare current weather to past weather to show similarities.
    -   App could display notes to users on how to deal with current weather (Give ideas to bundle up or enjoy a day at a nearby beach)
        -   This idea could use 2 external apis to make my backend more worth it. 

2. Figure out the apis I plan to use to make this app work.
    -   https://openweathermap.org/api
    -   https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api

3. How do I want this app designed?
    - Backend
        - Utilize the backend to have a userbase that can call up planned tasks.
        - Allow users to create planned tasks and pin them to dates.
        - Notify users when the weather changes.
        - Constantly feed through data to provide the use the best experience. 
    - Frontend
        - Display calendar for the user
